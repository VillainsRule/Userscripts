  <h3>a collection of the scripts on my greasyfork</h3>
</div>

<br>

most of these are:

1. shitty game cheats
2. developer utilities
3. bad web design fixes (guilded cough cough)

all of the scripts are on my [greasyfork profile](https://greasyfork.org/users/1300472) for easy installation.<br>
listing each script sounds like using a lot of time i don't have. read file names, or open my greasyfork.
